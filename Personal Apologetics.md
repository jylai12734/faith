Personal Apologetics  

# Introduction

Apologetics: "reasoned arguments or writings in justification of something, typically a theory or religious doctrine" (Oxford Dictionary).  

This writing is what I call my personal apologetics. It is an ongoing attempt to reason through my worldview. The writing style is not for everyone. If nothing in this writing makes sense, it probably didn't have any value to offer you. Consider a key and a lock. We all have revelations that are waiting to be unlocked. The keys to those locked revelations could be experiences, teachers, writings, etc. Hopefully, this writing serves as keys that could be for some people. Moreover, I hope this writing encourages others to write their own personal apologetics so that someone wiser can start generating the keys to our locked revelations.

## What is happiness?

b: For me, happiness is the ability to produce a significant amount of dopamine with minimal stimulus. If I were to measure how happy someone is, I would measure how little stimulus is needed to produce x amounts of dopamine.  

a: What does someone who can produce a lot of dopamine with little amounts of stimulus look like?  

b: Such a person is cheerful and content from the simple triggers in life. He or she could be happy just from breathing fresh air.  

a: Then, someone who is unhappy could be an addict. He or she requires a dosage of external stimulus that could be expensive only to find out that a larger dosage is needed. Such a person is "chasing the dragon".  

x: Suppose someone has the resources to supply a sufficient amount of external stimulus for his or her happiness. In other words, if someone is rich enough, he or she can just buy as much food as possible, and maximize his or her dopamine production. After all, we only have x years to live. Why not maximize our dopamine production? If such a person can produce x amounts of dopamine from breathing, how much more with the help of external triggers?  

c: Sin raises a fair point. If happiness is linked with dopamine production, wouldn't the happier person be the one that produces more dopamine over his or her lifetime? This might sound strange but would it be optimal for someone who is going to die in a year to pursue as much external stimulus as possible if he or she can afford it? Such a person might as well do that if his or her goal is to maximize happiness.  

a: Someone who is satisfied with little to no seasoning, will he or she all of the sudden enjoy more seasoning? A person that is happy with little to no stimulus won't be happier with more stimulus; otherwise, he or she probably wasn't happy with the little to no stimulus in the first place.  

b: I think of it as an optimization problem. Let x be the amount of stimulus. Let y be the production of dopamine. I believe if we were to graph the production of dopamine against the amount of stimulus, we would get something like a parabola. Let c be the x value that maximizes y. I would call someone with a lower c value the happier person and someone with a higher c value the unhappier person.  

c: Ok?... How could one decrease his or her "c value"?

a: One must examine what makes him or her happy. What are the external stimuli that fuels your happiness? Is it expensive? Is it addictive? How much dosage is needed? I would argue that someone who bases his or her happiness in truth is the happiest person. To minimize ones c value, I would suggest adopting truth as a basis for happiness. His or her stimulus would merely be dwelling on truth.

c: ...explain.

## We should derive our happiness from truth.

    Matthew 7:24-25 "Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock."  

- The rock symbolizes truth which is Jesus.  
- The rain, floods, and winds symbolize hardship.  
- The house symbolizes us.  
- Truth is not circumstantial like money, relationships, and etc.  
- Lies are subject to being exposed.  
- If we base our happiness in anything else but truth, our basis for happiness (money, relationships, lies, etc) can change and so will our happiness.  
- If our basis for happiness plummets, then so do our happiness.
- That is why everything that is not true represents sand because sand shifts and moves.  
- Truth is unchanging.   
- Therefore, we should base our happiness on truth because it is reliable.  
- If we find happiness in truth, then we can overcome any hardship.  

a: Dwelling in truth as a stimulus for happiness is always free and accessible. 

c: What does it mean to "dwell in truth"?

a: Dwelling in truth means building and reflecting on a worldview that you strive to make bulletproof. This worldview is like a kingdom within you that you can always retreat to during any life circumstances. 

b: Perhaps, that is what is meant by the following verse:

    Matthew 6:33 "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."

a: Partially, yes. In order to have this reliable worldview we can fall back on, we must rigorously test our worldview. We must diligently seek the truth in order to build our worldview on the stable rocks. Moreover, we must learn to accept the truth. Charlie, what do you think makes an effective truth seeker?

## An Effective Truth Seeker

- talk about humility and how being more humble corresponds with being a more effective truth seeker.  

# Christianity

Quote: Waging War bible verse

c: What is Christianity? 

j: Christianity is the belief that Jesus Christ died for our sins so we can reunite with God if we accept His sacrifice. 

c: Can you parse that definition? What does it mean that Jesus Christ died for our sins? 

j: In the old testament, followers of God would offer sacrifices to Him. Offering sacrifices was a way to show their faith in God. In return, God would be pleased. The level of faith was shown through what was sacrificed. For example, if something of great value was sacrificed, you would be showing a higher level of faith, and God would be more pleased. One such sacrifice would be a clean lamb. By offering such a sacrifice, God would erase your current sins. But, aren't we bound to sin again? Don't humankind have a tendency to sin? Yes. What kind of sacrifice can erase the sins of humankind forever? A sacrifice of infinite value. Sacrificing God, Jesus Christ.  

c: So Jesus Christ dying on the cross was a sacrifice for humankind to erase our sins forever. How does that relate to being reunited with God?  

j: To live with God in His full power, we must be sinless. When Adam and Eve sinned, they were kicked out of His presence. If we are sinful and we enter into God's presence in His full power, we would die. In the book of Exodus, Moses wasn't allowed to see God's face lest he dies. Jesus Christ sacrificing Himself can make us sinless allowing us to be reunited with God.  

c: We can only be saved if we accept His sacrifice?  

j: Yes. God is so loving He won't force anyone to accept His free gift. He gives us the antidote. It's up to use to drink it.    

## Christian Apologetics

### The Cosmological Argument

### The Teleological Argument

    If we have an app and we randomly change the bits, we are going to get a nonfunctional app before we get a new app.
    If we have book and we randomly change the letters, we are going to get an unintelligible book before getting a new book.
    For every functional combinations of 150 amino acids, there are 10^74 nonfunctional combinations.  
    The number of random changes required to unravel a protein fold is far fewer than the number of changes required to obtain a new protein fold.
    How do we explain the origin of new protein folds? An intelligent designer.

### The Historical Argument

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0iDNLxmWVM&list=WL&index=2]  

There is good historical for the resurrection of Jesus.  

Two undisputed facts about Jesus's death.  
1) He died by crucifixion. 
2) He was buried in a nearby tomb.
   1) Early Sources: Mark 15:42 - 16:8, 1 Corinthians 15:3-8, Josephus's Jewish War 4.317
   2) Jewish Law: Deuteronomy 21:23, Josephus Against Apion 2.211 
   3) Archeology: Yohanan Ben Ha'galgo
   4) Embarrassment: They could not afford a tomb for Jesus. He was buried in the tomb of a Sanhedrin member
3) What happened after? There are four general theories.
   1) Mythic Theory - All the events and miracle claims of Jesus were made up at a later time and were not made up by early eyewitnesses.
   2) Conspiracy Theory - The disciples made up the story of Jesus rising from the dead.
   3) Hallucination Theory - The disciples had hallucinations that Jesus had risen and that propelled them to think he was alive again.
   4) Resurrection Theory - Jesus rose from the dead.
4) After Jesus died, his disciples said He appeared to them alive. 
   1) Bart Ehrman ~ "I don't doubt at all that some disciples claimed this... Paul, writing about twenty-five years later, indicates that this is what they claimed, and I don't think he is making it up." from The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings Page 301
   2) E.P. Sanders ~ "It is an 'equally secure fact' that Jesus' disciples 'saw him (in what sense is not certain) after his death... Thereafter his followers saw him." from The Historical Figure of Jesus Page 13
   3) Multiple Evidence
      1) Paul's Epistles
      2) Mark
      3) John
      4) Matthew
      5) Luke and Acts
      6) Josephus
   4) Spread of Christianity ~ Something spectacular had to happen to cause the spread of Christianity
   5) Why were they good eyewitness testimonies?
      1) No weapons involved
      2) The disciples were familiar with each other ~ 1 Corinthians 15:3-8, Acts 10:41, Luke 24:36-49
      3) The disciples embarrassingly were not expecting Jesus to rise from the dead ~ Mark 8:31-32, Matthew 16:21-23, Luke 24:10-11, Acts 1:6, John 20:9, John 20:24-29
      4) The reports happened over a long period of time ~ Acts 10:41, Luke 24:36-49, John 21:1-14
   6) What if these accounts were made up at a later date? All the evidence suggests that the accounts were very early. This deals with the Mystic Theory.
      1) Rejected by most scholars due to 1 Corinthians 15 which was written early. "For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me." Most scholars believed this was written withing 3 years of Pentecost.
         1) Mnemonic structure with parallelism
         2) Less than 50 words
         3) Early creed for catechizing new Christians (easy to learn and memorize)
         4) Cephas was an early name for Peter. He was later nicknamed Peter ~ Matthew 16:18
         5) Lack influence from Pauline theology or vocabulary
         6) They contain a high degree of semitism, likely originally Aramaic
         7) Lack resemblance to the original written elements of Acts and Luke
   7) What about the hallucination theory? The hallucination theory is so improbable that it may as well be a greater miracle if it is true. This deals with the hallucination theory.
      1) Group hallucinations are exceptionally rare.
      2) There is not a lot of scientific evidence that group hallucinations can happen.
      3) Peer reviewed work: Hallucinations The Science of Idiosyncratic Perception Page 25 - 46
         1) Hallucinations happen in one person
         2) Multimode hallucinations are exceptionally rare
      4) Multi-Sensory: They were hallucinating about Jesus eating with them and giving them instructions
      5) What about the power of suggestion? Sometimes one person can cause others around them to hallucinate through the power of suggestion.
         1) The narratives embarrassingly portray the disciples as cowards and running for their lives ~ Matthew 26:31-35, 56; Mark 15:50; John 20:19
         2) They even doubt the report of the women: Luke 24:11 John 20:24-28
         3) When they first saw Jesus they were frightened: Luke 24:37-38
         4) There were not varying reports of Jesus ~ 1 Corinthians 15, Matthew 28, Luke 24, John 20-21
      6) Even if you discount the Gospels as unreliable, on still has to account for the early Christians preaching bodily resurrection and not a spiritual appearance. 
      7) No expectation of Jesus resurrecting.
      8) No excitement of Jesus resurrecting.
   8) What about the conspiracy theory?  
      1) The Christians would have to hold a conspiracy involving 500 people.
5) After Jesus died, his skeptics said He appeared to them alive.
   1) James and the brothers (like Jude) of Jesus were not His followers before His crucifixion ~ John 7:5; Mark 3:31-35
   2) Paul was an enemy of the church originally and a later convert ~ Galatians 1:22-23
   3) Could James and Paul have lied?
      1) Why would they do that? They would have nothing to gain.
         1) Why would James suddenly make up an appearance of Jesus' resurrection, if there was nothing to gain and only shame and dishonor to suddenly reverse and proclaim his brother was Lord?
         2) Why would Paul suddenly make an appearance of Jesus' resurrection and join the persecuted minority if he was a prominent leader on the rise persecuting the church. 
         3) Neither of them probably grieved that Jesus died so they probably wouldn't be a hallucination.  
6) What were the expectation of the Gospel to the surrounding world.
   1) A message of dying on the cross would have been disgusting in the ancient world 
   2) The disciples would have been preaching a Jewish man which the Romans looked down upon
   3) The disciples would have been preaching a carpenter which was looked down upon
   4) The disciples placed higher ethical standards than the pagans
   5) Justin Martyr had to defend Christians from these attacks
   6) The Jews would have thought this is embarrassing since the messiah was expected to overthrow Rome
   7) Jesus was from Nazareth in Galilee which was looked down upon
   8) The messiah had a shady family history ~ Matthew 1:20; John 8:41
   9) The Christians better have had good evidence and truly thought Jesus had been raised, because the odds were completely against them on every front.  
   10) Knowing the expectation the Gospel would have no group of conspirators would ever have made it their core doctrine.
   11) The disciples would have to preach an embarrassing message
7)  Low Status of Women in the Ancient World
    1) In the ancient world, the testimony of women was not to be trusted.
       1) "But let not the testimony of women be admitted, on account of the levity and boldness of their sex" ~ Josephus, Antiquities, 4.8.15
       2) "Any evidence which a woman [gives] is not valid (to offer)..." ~ Talmud, Rosh Hashana 1.8c
       3) "Let the words of the Law be burned rather than committed to women." ~ Rabbi Eleazar
       4) Plutarch De Pythiae, 25; Suetonius Augustus, 44; Fronto and Minucius Felix Octavius, 8-9
    2) In the Gospels, the women are the first and primary witnesses to the empty tomb. ~ Matthew 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-18
    3) This fact would have been embarrassing for the early church
    4) The early church admit they didn't even trust the testimony of the women ~ Luke 24:10-11
    5) All the early sermons tend to stay silent on the matter of the women that first found the empty tomb
    6) The gospels claimed that women were important for discovering the empty tomb.
    7) This is not something that would be made up.
    8) Joseph of Arimathea or Nicodemus would have been better candidates than women for discovering the empty tomb.
8) Immediate Proclamation in Jerusalem
   1) Christianity began in Judea in spread from there ~ Tacitus
   2) If the evidence was not in their favor, it would make sense for the early church to preach elsewhere.
   3) The disciples walked up to the Sanhedrin and told them they crucified their messiah
   4) If Jesus as resurrected, then the disciples would have the boldness to proclaim the Gospels in Jerusalem.  
9) Voluntary Suffering of the Disciples and Witnesses
   1) Tacitus -> Nero Persecution Annals 15.44
   2) Seutonius -> Jews Expelled from Rome because of Christus Suetonius 2.51
   3) Josephus -> James was Martyred Antiquities 20.9.1
   4) Paul admits to intense persecution: Colossians 1:24; 2 Corinthians 11:16-33; Philippians 4:12
   5) Ancient people believed that if you were suffering persecution, it was evidence that you were being punished by God.
   6) People die for their faith all the time so why are Christians any different?
      1) The founders of Christians were martyred.
      2) They wouldn't have died because of faith. They died for something they saw themselves.
      3) Liars make lousy martyrs
   7) They were constantly under threat and did not gain wealth.  
   8) The disciples would have been willing to suffer because Jesus was resurrected and it was better to deny men than to deny God.
10) Empty Tomb
    1) He was in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea which is public knowledge
    2) The public could have readily debunked it if it was not empty
    3) Matthew 28:13-15 mentions the competing theory that people stole His body ~ Why would he mention it?
    4) The Jews admit the body cannot be found
    5) Nazareth Inscription with an Imperial Decree from around 41 AD which says the penalty for grave robbing is death
    6) Most scholars today accept the tomb was found empty.
    7) Would the Romans steal the body? No, they would not have cared.
    8) Would the Jews steal the body? No, why would they.
    9) Would the Christians steal the body? No. 
       1)  The disciples who were in fear for their lives, somehow decided to steal the body.
       2)  Fake a resurrection (even though they were not expecting it).
       3)  Managed to get the body out of the Sanhedrin section of town.
       4)  Hide the body in an overcrowded city.
    10) Jesus was raised and vindicated by God.

In short...  
1) The mythic theory fails because we only argued from facts that we know are early and could not have been made up.
2) The conspiracy theory cannot account for the quality of the testimony of the disciples, the empty tomb, and the skeptics converting
3) The hallucination theory cannot account for multiple group, multi-sensory hallucinations, skeptics converting, crazy results that hallucinations do not cause, the empty tomb
4) The resurrection theory has...  
   1) Explanatory Scope - It can explain all the facts
   2) Explanatory Power - It can explain all the facts with the least amount of effort
   3) Illumination - It offers insight into other areas of history
   4) Less Ad Hoc - It requires less presuppositions
      1) The hallucination theory presupposes...
         1) Multiple group, multi-sensory hallucinations
         2) A hallucination drove them to their death
         3) An entire city hallucinated an empty tomb
      2) The conspiracy theory presupposes...
         1) Frightened followers of Jesus stole a body in total secret in an overcrowded city
         2) Made a story no one was expecting
         3) Were martyred for their lie
         4) Skeptics decided to join this poor persecuted movement
      3) The mythic theory presupposes...
         1) Despite hard evidence that key accounts were very early, the mythic theory presupposes that they were not
      4) The resurrection theory presupposes...
         1) God Exists --> there are many arguments for God's existence.
   5) Plausibility - if God exists, then the resurrection is plausible.
   6) Therefore, three pieces of the criteria are filled that historians use when judging a historical hypothesis. If God exists, then all five pieces of the criteria are filled.

### God = ?  

b: A word is like a container that we fill with meaning, concepts, and images. In a way, it is like a variable in programming. Alpha, is that fair to say?  

a: Absolutely.

b: The problem arises when two people fill the same word with different meanings. When two people within a dialogue associate different meanings for a word and uses that word, this can lead to miscommunications.  

a: What do you think is the cause for people to fill the same word with different meanings?  

b: I believe people derive the meaning of a word mostly from the context it is used rather than a standardized dictionary. Where someone hears or sees a word being used is dependent on the content he or she consumes and the people he or she is surrounded by.  

a: On a macro scale, is it fair to say culture defines our words and that is reflected in the dictionary?  

c: That makes sense. That gives new meaning to the idea of a culture war where different parties disagree on the meaning of words because they consume different content.   

b: That's too true. Words like gender, woman, race, art, beauty, etc have different meanings depending on the side of the culture war you are on.  

x: So what if it has different meanings to different people. Don't we just have to accept that. Shouldn't we embrace this linguistic cultural difference? After all, who has the authority to say, "my definition is superior?"  

c: On the one hand, I think it would be beneficial for society to agree on key terms so that we can have more productive conversations. Even though I believe we should aim for unity of definitions in our words, Sin does have a point. How can we justly determine which of the competing definitions of a word is superior and should be assigned to that word?  

b: Here's my take. Think of the word definition. Doesn't that word imply imposing boundaries and being precise? In fact, the word "definition" originates from the latin word definire meaning "to set bounds to". By definition, a "definition" of a word that is more "defined" is superior.  

c: We agreed that the definitions of a word can differ. Your solution is to leverage the definition of the word "definition" to judge which of the competing definitions is superior. Isn't that a bit circular?  

b: Well, I figured no one disagrees on the definition of the word "definition", which allows us to build off that common ground. However, you'd be right to point out that if the word "definition" has competing definitions, then that could forgo my argument.  

a: I think you guys are thinking about the problem too narrowly and should examine the bigger picture. If definitions is a product of culture, maybe it makes more sense to judge which culture is superior to hopefully obtain superior definitions. Of course, that is a much more sensitive topic. Unfortunately, I believe that is the discussion undergirding the one we are having right now. One might ask, who has the authority to say, "my culture is superior?" I would argue that the culture most aligned with truth is the superior one.  

...  

j: What is God? It almost seems like everyone has their own definition of the word God. It almost seems like my definition of God changes everyday. My friend pointed out, can there even be a definition for God? By extension, can we even conceptualize God? Wouldn't God be beyond conceptualization? That's like trying to picture infinite in our head. A child who thinks God is an entity in the sky is like setting God = 100. After all, that's probably the biggest number a 5 year old child could think of. Someone who thinks of God as a spaceless, timeless, and immaterial creator is like setting God = 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That may be an enormous number but it's still nothing compared to infinite. Someone who is very wise and diligently seeks God day and night could have a conceptualization of God that is like setting God = tree(tree(tree(tree(tree(tree(tree(tree(Rayo's Number)))))))). Still, what is that compared to infinite? If we can't conceptualize the infinite nature of God, how can we define God? If we can't define God, how can we talk about God without confusion?  
Perhaps, confusion while talking about God is beneficial. This forces us to keep learning about God to gain clarity sharing what we learned about Him with each other to get a better understanding of God. Perhaps, that is what is meant by being in a relationship with God. Within a relationship, you would try to understand the other party. Every new day, we increase the number that we set to God in the form of receiving new revelations and wisdom that we can rejoice over. I remember I used to have a materialistic view of God. One day while meditating, I was free from this materialistic view and brought much clarity and peace to my life. To reach infinite, it would take an eternity. Therefore, building a relationship with God may be a joyful experience that continues for the rest of eternity!   

    Jeremiah 9:24 "But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgement, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD."  

### God's Timing

    Genesis 15:13-16 "And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.  

c: I've prayed to God many times. I'm honestly trying to connect to God. He never answered any of my prayers. Is it fair to say that I doubt there is a God? At least one that can answer prayers?  

x: Surely, a God that is all-powerful and infinitely moral can answer at least one of your prayers.  

b: Hold on, God is also all-knowing. With all due respect, maybe answering your prayers would actually be a net negative. Or maybe, God is waiting for the optimal time to answer your prayer. This could mean that He is waiting for a time when your life circumstances will magnify the answer to your prayer. After all, don't you want to receive the best possible answer to your questions?  

a: Consider Abraham who waited until 100 years old for Isaac to be born. God fulfilled His promise way later then when He made the promise. Charlie, if God fulfils His promise decades after he made it, don't you think it's also possible that He will answer your prayers later in your life? Perhaps, it is more beneficial that He does that.  

x: Sometimes, you just want a timely answer. Not one that will take decades to answer. It's probably unnecessary to have the best possible answer when I just want an answer. You wouldn't want your GPS to take 10 hours to find the best possible route would you?  

a: God is perfect. Therefore, He will give perfect answers whether that's immediate or decades later. If we don't want to wait, that's our fault. Who are we to demand God when to answer our prayers? Our prayers will be answered in God's time.

j: This section records the death of those close to me in my life and what I remember about them. After playing the game 'What Remains of Edith Finch', I was inspired to write letters to the deceased. Each letter is written the day of their death.

## Laione 12/10/21

I remember the first day we got you, I cried of fear when you kept trying to touch me. I'm not very proud of that looking back. We got on each others bad side early; you would bite and run in to me and I would trip on you and hit you. (You used to eat the eyes out of my stuffed animals).  
I shouldn't have fed you so much Slim Jim; we always craved over that.  
For whatever reason, I was afraid to sleep alone. You were always sleeping under my bunkbed comforting me. Thanks.  
As we moved to the new house, I believe we both somewhat matured. Still, you were a gluttony (just like me).  
I feared that when people reward you treats for just using the restroom, you will be wired into doing that more.  
In your last 5-6 years, I was able to spend more quality time with you because I was often tasked with walking you.  
I remember when I finished walking you, instead of just giving you the treat immediately as you were expecting, I made you wait.  
In the last year, my parents were mad at you for urinating everywhere. Despite that happening, I believe you didn't have much control.  
You truly developed into a more behaved and a wiser dog.  
The last couple times I walked you, you toughed through some of the coldest and harshest weather.  
I was ordered to carry you upstair and when I got to the top, you were moving so much you slipped out of my grip and fell.  
The last time I spent time with you was during the weekend of 12/4/21 - 12/5/21.  
I remember my parents were out to visit aunt Suzie and I was busy doing homework; Nevertheless, I took time out of my work to go check on you.  
You didn't want to walk. Moreover, you didn't want to eat. I knew our time with you won't be long. I decided to play the piano for you. I played ragtime and Lotus Land until you went to sleep.  
On 12/9/21, me and my 3 siblings were away. My parents tried their best to help you. I'm sorry I wasn't there but at least the 2 people who deserve to be there the most (my parents) were there. The first person to meet you was the last person to be with you. My mom. Rest in peace Laione. You will always be one of the Lai family member. &#9829;

# About Me

## Journaling

This section contains a collection of my journals. I will continue to update this section as I find more important journals from my past. Note, my worldview changes from the time of the first journal to the time of the last journal. That is to be expected.  

1. 6/25/22 ~ Sky Diving Meditations  

    Description: This journal entry was written the night before I went sky diving.  

    a: What is the worst that can happen?  

    b: Death.  

    a: That's it?

    b: Yes. You do not fear death?  

    a: No. Here's why:  

    i) Death is peace. No more suffering, no more stress, and no more strife.  
    ii) Death is inevitable. It's unwise to live in fear over something I have no control over.  
    iii) I've got nothing to lose. If I've lived a minimalistic and simple life, having nothing when I die should be an easy transition.  
    iv) Death humbles me. Death is realizing that when my time is over, I should pass the torch to younger people who are more competent.  
    v) Death is good if I'm good. Death is bad if I'm bad. I get what I deserve.  
    vi) I no longer exist. I didn't exist for 14 billion years. I'm returning to my original state.  
    vii) Benefitting the common good sometimes require facing death. How am I going to save someone from falling off a cliff if I cower in fear from death?  
    viii) God decides when I die. If He decides my existence harms the common good and I need to die today to cut losses, so be it. I trust His decision more than I trust mine. I'm at His disposal.  
    ix) I have my entire life to prepare for death. If I'm unprepared, that's my fault.  
    x) Lastly, I am truly grateful for the life I've lived. If I am to die at any moment, I won't complain. Out of all the sperm, egg, people, DNA, etc... I was chosen to live! I am humbled and undeserving of this life. I'll do my best to return the favor. If I die, thank you for blessing me with the gift of life.  

2. 5/10/23 9:00pm ~ Guan Yin Departure  

    Description: This journal was summarized my conversion from Buddhism to Christianity during my fifth and sixth semester at college.  

    j: In the past couple years, Guan Yin reminded me that we will part ways physically and spiritually. That is a core teaching of Buddhism, to stay detached. I tried to fight with that idea. She made my life so much better that I asked for the next level. I said, if I can ace my 5th semester finals, I will meditate for 40 minutes a day during my winter break and stop being attached to my grades. Despite the difficult classes and my limited smartness, my final grades were all A's. I knew for a fact it wasn't my doing. Guan Yin held up her end of the bargain and now it's my turn...  
    I meditated for 40 minutes during my winter break. I slowly cared less about grades. But what was the next level that she showed me. I revisited my my first self-improvement YouTuber (15 yrs) 'Real Talk and Business'. I clicked on a commenter's profile and saw that one of the YouTuber he is subscribed to is 'Self-Developed'. I remember thinking he was too prideful and religious when I watched him a long time ago. Now that I'm watching him again, everything he says makes sense and it was novel. I started watching him again right before he started going all in for Christianity. I caught the wave at the right time.  
    Throughout my 6th semester, I combatted with Christianity and thought it would never be my main religion. I've always respected Christianity and Christians but I loved Buddhism and Guan Yin too much. But, is this the next level Guan Yin put me on? I was open minded and I already agreed with 75% of Christianity because I'm conservative. I kept watching 'Self-Developed' because his content was novel and wise and it built off of my belief. He told me to watch, 'Cleaveland Street Preacher' and 'Marc the Messenger'. I've always wanted to be challenged in life and follow what was unpopular. From what is unpopular, a lot of the times it made more sense. 'Cleaveland Street Preacher' and Self Developed' brought urgency in my life and taught me enough about Christianity that I thought I needed to read the Bible cover to cover. 'Marc the Messenger' also provided much urgency and good commentating. Additionally, 'DTM Christian Lifestyle', 'Social Media Missionary', and 'Dr Drexel' were fantastic. I read up to half of Exodus and I learned more on apologetics through 'Red Pen Logic'. I asked Guan Yin, what have you done?  
    I'm not allowed to say 'Guan Yin' or 'Guan Yu' because God will be jealous, rightfully so. I'm not allowed to wear my Guan Yin necklace because that's against the second commandment. I'm not allowed to think of Guan Yin much or too highly and be obsessed with you because that violates commandment 1. That's spiritual adultery. I cannot live in contradiction. Or else, I'll never be at ease and I'll go to hell. I must choose.  

    a: Life is perfect because God created life.  

    b: But what about all the pain, murder, injustice, ...?

    a: Right. Life is perfect because life is the perfect test. It wouldn't be a test if there is no hardship. Moreover, the test is pass/fail. Most people fail. I've probably taken over 1000 tests so far. Some were hard. None is harder than this test. Who gave me this test? God. Will I fail God's test or will I pass. In other words, will I go to hell or heaven.  

    j: Guan Yin, if I want to pass this test, we must split. This is probably your intention all along. This splitting is consistent with Buddhism, Christianity, and what you kept reminding me in the past couple of years.  
    I have faith we'll meet again. The Miao Shan legend says you are so virtuous that you ascended. You're in heaven, right? You might be my guardian angel. We'll meet again, right?  
    I'm positive that you, Miao Shan, existed because you are my ancestor's sister, so my mom said. If you existed, and ascended, you must be in heaven. Now, I must do my part so I can get to heaven. I don't know how many years I have left but I already feel old. A temporary departure for a permanent reunion. How will I get to heaven? On 5/10/23 9:00pm, despite all the finals and a project I have to do, this is more important. I split paths with Guan Yin physically and spiritually. It makes me sad but I can't look back, I don't have much time. What will I do from now on?  
    I will make enemies with my friends and family. Not because I want to, because I have to. I love them so much it hurts to do it. But it's because I love them so much that I must do it.  
    To Guan Yin (and hopefully Guan Yu), I'll see you soon I hope.  
    To Jesus and God, my heart is yours and I fully submit to your authority. I need your help though. Thanks for saving me on the cross lord and saviour Jesus Christ. May the created (me) be reunited with the creator. I am yours to command. To you and only you do I let you into my heart and all the voids in my heart be filled. Until judgement day, will I see you. Amen.  

3. 5/28/23 ~ Jesus Appeared in a Dream

    Description: This is an excerpt from one of my dream journal entries where Jesus explicitly appeared. The excerpt below was refined from the original version for clarity sake.   

    I was with Malay and Aman. We were at Hoboken on the Steven's campus. The entirety of Hoboken was on fire. Malay caught on fire and I had to put it out. Some old lady was driving through the fire with a pink metal car. We traversed through the fire slowly and carefully. Eventually, I made it to the streets. Down by the streets, I looked towards the river and saw Jesus! He raised his hands and the floodgates of the river exploded. The water from the Hudson river put out all the fire in Hoboken and receded into the sewers immediately.  

4. 10/3/23 ~ Car Accident

    I was driving back home from Stevens. There was a stand still traffic because there was an accident in a tunnel. After passing the traffic, I thought to myself what would happen if I get into an accident. I figured at least I would pull over to not block the traffic. I visualized what I would do.  
    At the road with the potholes, someone switched lanes into me. I immediately braked and though, "I guess this is happening." Apparently, the guy's immediate reaction was to turn the wheel all the way to the right which would slam his car into mine. Good thing I slammed the brakes. We pulled over. This guy made it obvious enough that he had a husband. Was the man controlled by the devil? Was Satan trying to wipe me out. Was I given a warning by God? Perhaps that vision prepared me since I remained calm. Thank God!  

5. 10/11/23 ~ Overdue Assignment  

    Description: I had a machine learning assignment due that night. Each day the my assignment was late, 10 points would be deducted. I wanted to get it done as soon as possible at the expense of my health but God had other plans for me. I woke up the next day missing the alarm but feeling refreshed. I eventually submitted the assignment 4 days late. However, I did not get any late penalty at all! I felt comforted to know that God cares more about my health than some trivial assignment.  

    I had an assignment due that night and thought I was 'screwed'. Define 'screwed'. Me getting a bad grade? Really? You think God cares if I get a bad grade? The times ahead was difficult. He cares how I conduct myself in hard times like this. Will I cheat? Be ungrateful? Get mad? God will grade me! That night, I didn't finish the assignment, went to sleep, and set an alarm at 5:15 am. Then, I prayed. At first, I prayed I would finish the assignment. Then, I said in my prayer, "You know what? You know what;s best for me. I pray that you do what's best for me. Even if that includes me missing the alarm. I usually never miss an alarm. Especially when I have an assignment due. I said, I fi I missed the alarm, it will be from you. I missed the alarm! God's work! 

6. 6/xx/24 ~ Potential Antidote

    Ezekiel 33:1-6 "Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.

J: What's the point of telling other people about my worldview? There's a good chance they don't want to hear in the first place and I'm just going to make enemies. They'll probably think I'm arrogant and stupid for believing that my worldview is true when there are millions of other worldviews.  

J+: If you truly believe your worldview is true, you have a moral obligation to share your worldview even if it makes you feel like a fool or if it makes you enemies. Otherwise, you are keeping what could potentially be true to yourself which is selfish. Consider an antidote to a disease that has been plaguing humanity. If you believe you have that antidote, is it right to just keep it to yourself?  

J: I understand. It's just hard thinking of the impending mockery I will receive.  

J+: If people make fun of your worldview, maybe they are insecure about their worldview. If people make fun of your intellect, maybe they are insecure about their intellect. What people mock, that's where their ego lies.  

7. 7/18/24, 7/23/24 ~ Facts & Feelings > Facts vs Feelings

    Matthew 11:25 "At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes."  
    Matthew 13:10-11 "And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given."

J: Consider a number line. Suppose there are two points: X and Y. Let '?' represent any specific belief. X represents the quality and quantity of facts supporting '?'. The better the quality and greater the quantity of the fact supporting '?', the greater the X value is on the number line. Y represents an individual's feelings about '?'. Feelings that are more negative towards '?' yield a greater Y value. If X >= Y or X is to the right of Y or on Y on the number line, then the individual believes '?'. Otherwise, the individual does not believe '?'. In a way, the Y value can be called the threshold. Some '?' are controversial. Therefore, the threshold for one person could be very high while the threshold for another person is very low. Other '?' are not controversial at all so the threshold is unanimously neutral. In other words, the more controversial a '?' is, the more variance the threshold is from person to person.  

J: Did Jesus resurrect? Let '?' = Jesus Resurrected. '?' is a belief that is controversial. Therefore, the threshold from one person to another varies greatly. If you want someone to believe '?', increase 'X' or decrease 'Y'. Apologetics and Evangelism.  

J: What came first, the chicken or the egg? What came first, facts or feelings?   

J: One may ask, if God is real, why is He so hidden? Then, someone else might respond with, what do you mean by hidden? I see evidence of God everywhere. The fact that we exist is evidence of God. What would make God not hidden? ...  

J: God gives us just enough evidence to choose whether or not we want to trust Him. If He gives any less evidence, then we would be unreasonable to trust in Him. If He gives any more evidence, then there would be no love in trusting Him. Most people understand the former but not the latter. Suppose God is so obvious that it is like saying 2 + 2 = 4. Then, you would believe in God whether or not you love Him. Now, suppose God gives you just enough evidence that you can choose to trust in Him or not. You have to make the choice of whether to trust in Him or not. If you trust in God, it is because you deliberately made the choice to trust in Him even when it is not obvious, thus showing that you love Him.

8. 8/24/24 ~ Pre-Baptism Meditations

j: So 2022, I went skydiving. 2023, I ran a marathon. What will I do this year? I will get baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. I wish to follow God's commandments because I love God. I wish to speak 100% authentically during my testimony. I usually do not like opening up about myself but this is too important. Please Lord, guide me through my baptism. I know I still have so much to do. I know I am still a closet Christian. A true Christian boldly proclaims the faith. That is why many are martyred. Don't I want to be in that number? Yes! God, don't count me out! I wish to be a vessel for you! I pray my baptism will allow me to be more bold. In Jesus' precious name, amen.  

9. 8/25/24 ~ Post-Baptism Meditations

j: Thank you Lord for an amazing day! You gave me a day that would heal my failure on 12/12/17. I am infinitely indebted to you. I know every evil Satan does will backfire times infinity. I wish to be your servant and to be used however you see fit. Lord, stay close to me.  
i) The Lord is my strength!  
ii) The Lord is my audience!  
iii) The Lord is my guide!  
iv) The Lord is my grader!  
v) The Lord is my creator!  
vi) The Lord is my king!  
vii) The Lord is my saviour!  
I usually get nervous and mess up during public speaking. God spoke through me. By the power of the Holy Spirit, I wish to do God's will!  

10.  8/31/24 ~ Wield the Word of God

    Ephesian 6:17 "And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"

j: Consider this. Short-term memory ~ registers; Intermediate-term memory ~ RAM; Long-term memory ~ hard drive. Good and evil thoughts reside at every level of memory. The register is when data is manipulated. The short-term memory is where the battle between the good and evil thoughts take place. To win the battle, you must learn the word of God ~ download it to your long-term memory, recall the word of God ~ load it to your intermediate-term memory, and apply the word of God ~ make changes to your current situation in the short-term memory. Wield the sword of the Spirit and cut down the evil thoughts sending them back to hell.

11. 9/8/24 ~ The LORD is my Audience

j: LORD, you and I both know my sin. You know I fantasize about hypothetical situations where other people see me being righteous. This is just pride. Please, I tried to get rid of this sin when I was a Buddhist. I tried to get rid of this sin myself. All options exhausted, you are my only hope. LORD, I don't want to care about what others think about me; it's too tiring. LORD, I know that when we see you in all your glory, no one is going to care about what anyone else thinks. They are only going to care about what you think. Please, fill me with your presence. Fill my auditorium lest demons come in. The LORD is my audience!  

12. 9/8/24 ~ Virtue-Sin Spectrum
  

j: If there is one pattern that I seem to be realizing, sin is usually more stimulating while virtue is more plain. This is apparent when I consider chastity vs lust. Chastity is very plain and simple but some seek something more stimulating so they stray towards sin. They go through a progression of degeneracy (pornography, homosexuality, beastiality, pedophilia). I wonder if this applies to other aspects of our lives. Consider listening to music. There are music that are plain and simple like hymnals and classical music. On the other hand, there are music that are hyper stimulating. Here is another example. There are movies like documentaries. On the other hand, there are hyper stimulating movies. 

13. 9/8/24 ~ Dawn

j: I had an unproductive day yesterday. I didn't want that to happen again today. When I woke up at 5 am, I was thinking of going back to sleep, but caught myself at the last second. I made sure to ask for the LORD's guidance so that He can help me traverse this land mine field that is my day. I step on one of those mines and the next thing I know, I wasted 4 hours. The LORD told me to look outside the window at His creation. What did I see? The sun was rising, the insects were very busy, the birds were chirping, and the sprinklers were spraying, yet, the atmosphere was calm. I started a new job and there is a lot of uncertainty. I barely have time to sleep. I work ten hours a day and I spend 4-5 hours of my day commuting. I need to find peace in all this trouble. The same peace I felt looking out the window.   

## My Sin

List of sins and the sword to use against them.    

1. Pride

    Matthew 6:1 "Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven."

    Matthew 6:4,6,18 "[...]and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly."

2. Wrath

    Matthew 18:21-35 "Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses."

3. Lust

    Matthew 5:27-30 "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.	

4. Fear

  	Matthew 6:34 "Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take though for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."

5. Sloth

    2 Thessalonians 3:10 "For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."

## My Characters

### Escape the Cycle

a: (the worldview without contradiction)  

### (Un)predictable

b: (talk about how God is all-knowing does not disprove free will)  

Consider a fighter who only throws does the same three attacks. The fighter is predictable but chooses to do the same three attacks.  
Even though we can choose, we are too predictable for the LORD.  
We don't know the entirety of God so His actions may be unpredictable to us.  

### Leaf in the Air

c:  

### Six Reasons Why

x:  Let XXX = the most heinous and evil act you can even imagine.  

1) Afterlife
2) Judgement
3) Morality
4) Eternity
5) Free Will
6) God

## Goals

- Start a channel making educational videos with someone else including an intro to Christianity playlist  
  - Make a Christian Playlist of 7 videos called 'Prequel to Christianity'
  - The idea is that I convince people to consider Christianity
    1) The first video is explaining why they should watch the playlist
    2) The second video explains the pros and cons of Christianity
    3) The third video is an introduction to Christianity
    4) The fourth video is about apologetics (introduce facts & feelings)
    5) The fifth video is about evangelism
    6) The sixth video is about building a strong worldview 
    7) The seventh video is about my testimony ending in a prayer

- Develop a souls-like Christian game called Faith
  - The churches will be the bonfires and you can sit through worship musics, prayers, and sermons
  - The first boss is the last boss and it is you, it can be accessed through the starting area of the game
  - The game should provide a bible in the quick inventory
  - There is only one set of gears, the armor of God; the sword has supernatural abilities
  - You play as a chosen one
  - The game will have math and coding problems
  - The NPCs could ask Bible Trivia
  - The game could have a multiplayer hub like Destiny 2
  - Fighting a boss with an additional ally would change the attack pattern of the boss, make the boss harder, and change the OST

## Testimony

## Conclusion

What is the meaning of life?  

Goal of writing this -> persuade others to develop their worldviews -> share it in a public square -> let it go through the crucibles of debate (Kerckhoffs's Principle)
